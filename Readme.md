## Description

In Javanese, the word "tai" means dirty, so to maintain politeness and cleanliness, it is replaced with "ee."
Thatâ€™s why this program is named **"EEKO"** instead of **"TAIKO."**

## EEKO Features

- **Voting Mode (Low-Fee Transactions)**: If the gas fee is above the specified limit, the script switches to a voting method. This helps reduce transaction costs, but does not accrue point value.
- **Wrap/Unwrap Mode (Earn Points)**: When the gas fee drops below the specified limit, the script returns to using the wrap/unwrap method. This allows point value to be collected with each transaction.
- **Automatic Count and Fee Tracking**: The system saves transaction counts and total fees, allowing you to resume transactions seamlessly.
- **Auto Stop for Wrap/Unwrap**: The process halts once the total transaction fee is reached.
- **Transaction Notifications**: The system will send notifications via Telegram when transactions are completed or if any errors occur during the process

## VOTE_EEKO Features

- **Before voting, ensure that the balance is in ETH to avoid a shortage of transaction fees.**

- **Controlled Transaction Spam**: Send a specific number of transactions, as specified by the user. This feature enables targeted transaction spamming.
